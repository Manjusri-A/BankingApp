 ## Banking App
######The Banking App is a Java-based console application designed to simulate basic banking functionalities. It allows users to create accounts, perform banking operations such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money, and manage card details like PIN numbers and expiry years. The application provides an interactive, menu-driven interface for users to manage accounts and cards conveniently. With simple and intuitive navigation, it offers essential banking features for personal use or as an educational project to learn Java programming concepts like classes, objects, and collections.

######This project is built with scalability and user-friendliness in mind, featuring a well-structured codebase with specific classes to handle different functionalities, such as BankingSystem for account operations and CardSystems for card-related details. Future enhancements could include transaction history, interest calculations, and user authentication to further extend the app's capabilities. This application serves as an excellent example for students or beginners learning Java and object-oriented programming while simulating real-world use cases.
